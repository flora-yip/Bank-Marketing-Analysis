## Project Objective
This project aims to identify customer segments most likely to subscribe to a term deposit. The insights help banks design effective marketing strategies to increase subscription rates.


## Project Description

### What is a term deposit?
A term deposit is a fixed-term investment where funds are locked for a set period and can only be withdrawn once the term ends. Banks typically use these deposits to generate profit by investing in higher-yield financial products or lending the funds at higher interest rates.

### Overview
The goal is to build predictive models that help banks target the right audience for term deposit subscriptions. The analysis focuses on answering three key questions:
  1. Which variables impact customersâ€™ decisions to subscribe? 
  2. Which customer segments show the highest likelihood of subscribing? 
  3. How can banks refine their marketing campaigns using these insights?
