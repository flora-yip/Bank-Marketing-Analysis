## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify customer segments that are most likely to subscribe a term deposit. The insights are useful for developing suitable marketing strategies to target the customers and increase their likelihood to open a term deposit account.


## Project Description

### What is a term deposit?
A term deposit is a fixed-term investment at banks where money would be locked up for a period of time and customers can withdraw their funds after the term ends. Common ways that banks can benefit from the money that customers place in a term deposit are investing in other financial products that pay a higher rate of return, or lending the money to other clients and receiving a higher interest rate. 

### Overview
This project aims to help banks identify the right audience who are most likely to subscribe a term deposit so that they could develop suitable marketing strategies. Multiple models were developed to find the optimal model that can best predict whether the customers will subscribe a term deposit and identify target audience. The insights will answer these 3 questions:
  1. Which variables impact customersâ€™ decisions to subscribe a term deposit? 
  2. Which customer segments are most likely to subscribe a term deposit? 
  3. How should banks target these customers?
